Aging changes in body shape,"Your body shape changes naturally as you age. You cannot avoid some of these changes, but your lifestyle choices may slow or speed the process.The human body is made up of fat tissue, lean tissue (muscles and organs), bones, and water. After age 30, people tend to lose lean tissue. Your muscles, liver, kidney, and other organs may lose some of their cells. This process of muscle loss is called atrophy. Bones may lose some of their minerals and become less dense (a process that may lead to a condition called osteopenia in the early stages and osteoporosis in the later stages). Tissue loss reduces the amount of water in your body.The amount of body fat goes up steadily after age 30. Older people may have almost one third more fat compared to when they were younger. Fat tissue builds up toward the center of the body, including around the internal organs. However, the layer of fat under the skin gets smaller.The tendency to become shorter occurs among all races and both sexes. Height loss is related to aging changes in the bones, muscles, and joints. As people age, several things can cause height loss:The gel-like disks between the vertebrae in the spine dry out and flatten. This shortens the spaces between the vertebrae.Muscle loss and loss of core strength can lead to a more stooped posture.Feet tend to flatten with age.Osteoporosis can cause micro fractures in the spine.People typically lose almost one-half inch (about 1 centimeter) every 10 years after age 40. Height loss is even more rapid after age 70. You may lose a total of 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7.5 centimeters) in height as you age. You can help lessen height loss by following a healthy diet, staying physically active, and preventing and treating bone loss.Smaller leg muscles and stiffer joints can make moving around harder. Excess body fat and changes in body shape can affect your balance. These body changes can make falls more likely.Changes in total body weight vary for men and women. Men often gain weight until about age 55, and then begin to lose weight later in life. This may be related to a drop in the male sex hormone testosterone. Women usually gain weight until age 65, and then begin to lose weight. Weight loss later in life occurs partly because fat replaces lean muscle tissue, and fat weighs less than muscle. Diet and exercise habits can play a large role in a person's weight changes over their lifetime.Your lifestyle choices affect how quickly the aging process takes place. Some things you can do to reduce age-related body changes are:Get regular exercise.Eat a healthy diet that includes fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and the right amounts of healthy fats.Limit your alcohol use.Avoid tobacco products and illicit drugs.",
Aging changes in hair and nails,"Your hair and nails help protect your body. They also keep the temperature of your body steady. As you age, your hair and nails begin to change. HAIR CHANGES AND THEIR EFFECTS Hair color change. This is one of the clearest signs of aging. Hair color is due to a pigment called melanin, which hair follicles produce. Hair follicles are structures in the skin that make and grow hair. With aging, the follicles make less melanin, and this causes gray hair. Graying often begins in the 30s.Scalp hair often starts graying at the temples and extends to the top of the scalp. Hair color becomes lighter, eventually turning white.Body and facial hair also turn gray, but most often, this happens later than scalp hair. Hair in the armpit, chest, and pubic area may gray less or not at all.Graying is largely determined by your genes. Gray hair tends to occur earlier in white people and later in Asians. Nutritional supplements, vitamins, and other products will not stop or decrease the rate of graying.Hair thickness change. Hair is made of many protein strands. A single hair has a normal life between 2 and 7 years. That hair then falls out and is replaced with a new hair. How much hair you have on your body and head is also determined by your genes.Nearly everyone has some hair loss with aging. The rate of hair growth also slows.Hair strands become smaller and have less pigment. So the thick, coarse hair of a young adult eventually becomes thin, fine, light-colored hair. Many hair follicles stop producing new hairs.Men may start showing signs of baldness by the time they are 30 years old. Many men are nearly bald by age 60. A type of baldness related to the normal function of the male hormone testosterone is called male-pattern baldness. Hair loss may be at the temples or at the top of the head.Women can develop a similar type of baldness as they age. This is called female-pattern baldness. Hair becomes less dense and the scalp may become visible.As you age, your body and face also lose hair. Women's remaining facial hair may get coarser, most often on the chin and around the lips. Men may grow longer and coarser eyebrow, ear, and nose hair.Contact your health care provider if you have sudden hair loss. This can be a symptom of a health problem. NAIL CHANGES AND THEIR EFFECTS Your nails also change with age. They grow more slowly and may become dull and brittle. They may also become yellowed and opaque.Nails, particularly toenails, may become hard and thick. Ingrown toenails may be more common. The tips of the fingernails may break.Lengthwise ridges may develop in the fingernails and toenails.Check with your provider if your nails develop pits, ridges, lines, changes in shape, or other changes. These can be related to iron deficiency, kidney disease, and nutritional deficiencies.OTHER CHANGESAs you grow older, you will have other changes, including:In the skinIn the face",
Aging changes in hormone production,"The endocrine system is made up of organs and tissues that produce hormones. Hormones are natural chemicals produced in one location, released into the bloodstream, and then used by other target organs and systems.Hormones control the target organs. Some organ systems have their own internal control systems along with, or instead of, hormones.As we age, changes naturally occur in the way body systems are controlled. Some target tissues become less sensitive to their controlling hormone. The amount of hormones produced may also change.Blood levels of some hormones increase, some decrease, and some are unchanged. Hormones are also broken down (metabolized) more slowly.Many of the organs that produce hormones are controlled by other hormones. Aging also changes this process. For example, an endocrine tissue may produce less of its hormone than it did at a younger age, or it may produce the same amount at a slower rate.AGING CHANGESThe hypothalamus is located in the brain. It produces hormones that control the other structures in the endocrine system, including the pituitary gland. The amount of these regulating hormones stays about the same, but the response by the endocrine organs can change as we age.The pituitary gland is located just below (anterior pituitary) or in (posterior pituitary) the brain. This gland reaches its maximum size in middle age and then gradually becomes smaller. It has two parts:The back (posterior) part stores hormones produced in the hypothalamus.The front (anterior) part produces hormones that affect growth, the thyroid gland (TSH), adrenal cortex, ovaries, testes, and breasts.The thyroid gland is located in the neck. It produces hormones that help control metabolism. With aging, the thyroid may become lumpy (nodular). Metabolism slows over time, beginning at around age 20. Because thyroid hormones are produced and broken down (metabolized) at the same rate, thyroid function tests are most often still normal. In some people, thyroid hormone levels may rise, leading to an increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease.The parathyroid glands are four tiny glands located around the thyroid. Parathyroid hormone affects calcium and phosphate levels, which affect bone strength. Parathyroid hormone levels rise with age, which may contribute to osteoporosis.Insulin is produced by the pancreas. It helps sugar (glucose) go from the blood to the inside of cells, where it can be used for energy.The average fasting glucose level rises 6 to 14 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) every 10 years after age 50 as the cells become less sensitive to the effects of insulin. Once the level reaches 126 mg/dL or higher, the person is considered to have diabetes.The adrenal glands are located just above the kidneys. The adrenal cortex, the surface layer, produces the hormones aldosterone, cortisol, and dehydroepiandrosterone.Aldosterone regulates fluid and electrolyte balance.Cortisol is the ""stress response"" hormone. It affects the breakdown of glucose, protein, and fat, and it has anti-inflammatory and anti-allergy effects. Aldosterone release decreases with age. This decrease can contribute to lightheadedness and a drop in blood pressure with sudden position changes (orthostatic hypotension). Cortisol release also decreases with aging, but the blood level of this hormone stays about the same. Dehydroepiandrosterone levels also drop. The effects of this drop on the body are not clear.The ovaries and testes have two functions. They produce the reproductive cells (ova and sperm). They also produce the sex hormones that control secondary sex characteristics, such as breasts and facial hair.With aging, men often have a lower level of testosterone.Women have lower levels of estradiol and other estrogen hormones after menopause. EFFECT OF CHANGESOverall, some hormones decrease, some do not change, and some increase with age. Hormones that usually decrease include:AldosteroneCalcitoninGrowth hormoneReninIn women, estrogen and prolactin levels often decrease significantly.Hormones that most often remain unchanged or only slightly decrease include:CortisolEpinephrineInsulinThyroid hormones T3 and T4Testosterone levels usually decrease gradually as men age.Hormones that may increase include:Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)Luteinizing hormone (LH)NorepinephrineParathyroid hormoneRELATED TOPICSAging changes in immunityAging changes in organs, tissues, and cellsAging changes in the male reproductive systemMenopause",
Aging changes in immunity,"Your immune system helps protect your body from foreign or harmful substances. Examples are bacteria, viruses, toxins, cancer cells, and blood or tissues from another person. The immune system makes cells and antibodies that destroy these harmful substances.AGING CHANGES AND THEIR EFFECTS ON THE IMMUNE SYSTEMAs you grow older, your immune system does not work as well. The following immune system changes may occur:The immune system becomes slower to respond. This increases your risk of getting sick. Flu shots or other vaccines may not work as well or protect you for as long as expected.An autoimmune disorder may develop. This is a disease in which the immune system mistakenly attacks and damages or destroys healthy body tissues.Your body may heal more slowly. There are fewer immune cells in the body to bring about healing.The immune system's ability to detect and correct cell defects also declines. This can result in an increased risk of cancer. PREVENTIONTo decrease the risks from immune system aging:Get vaccines to prevent the flu, shingles, and pneumococcal infections, as well as any other vaccines your health care provider recommends.Get plenty of exercise. Exercise helps boost your immune system.Eat healthy foods. Good nutrition keeps your immune system strong.Do not smoke. Smoking weakens your immune system.Limit your intake of alcohol. Ask your provider how much alcohol is safe for you.Look into safety measures to prevent falls and injuries. A weak immune system can slow healing from injuries. OTHER CHANGESAs you grow older, you will have other changes, including in your:Hormone productionOrgans, tissues, and cells",
"Aging changes in organs, tissue and cells","All vital organs begin to lose some function as you age. Aging changes occur in all of the body's cells, tissues, and organs, and these changes affect the functioning of all body systems.Living tissue is made up of cells. There are many different types of cells, but all have the same basic structure. Tissues are layers of similar cells that perform a specific function. The different kinds of tissues group together to form organs.There are four basic types of tissue:Connective tissue supports other tissues and binds them together. This includes bone, blood, and lymph tissues, as well as the tissues that give support and structure to the skin and internal organs.Epithelial tissue provides a covering for superficial and deeper body layers. The skin and the linings of the passages inside the body, such as the gastrointestinal system, are made of epithelial tissue.Muscle tissue includes three types of tissue:Striated muscles, such as those that move the skeleton (also called voluntary muscle)Smooth muscles (also called involuntary muscle), such as the muscles contained in the stomach and other internal organs like the female uterusCardiac muscle, which makes up most of the heart wall (also an involuntary muscle)Nerve tissue is made up of nerve cells (neurons) and is used to carry messages to and from various parts of the body. The brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves are made of nerve tissue.Watch this video about:Nerve conductionAGING CHANGESCells are the basic building blocks of tissues. All cells experience changes with aging. They become larger and are less able to divide and multiply. Among other changes, there is an increase in pigments and fatty substances inside the cell (lipids). Many cells lose their ability to function, or they begin to function abnormally.As aging continues, waste products build up in tissue. A fatty brown pigment called lipofuscin collects in many tissues, as do other fatty substances.Connective tissue changes, becoming more stiff. This makes the organs, blood vessels, and airways more rigid. Cell membranes change, so many tissues have more trouble getting oxygen and nutrients and removing carbon dioxide and other wastes.Many tissues lose mass. This process is called atrophy. Some tissues become lumpy (nodular) or more rigid.Because of cell and tissue changes, your organs also change as you age. Aging organs slowly lose function. Most people do not notice this loss immediately, because you rarely need to use your organs to their fullest ability.Organs have a reserve ability to function beyond the usual needs. For example, the heart of a 20-year-old is capable of pumping about 10 times the amount of blood that is actually needed to keep the body alive. After age 30, an average of 1% of this reserve is lost each year.The biggest changes in organ reserve occur in the heart, lungs, and kidneys. The amount of reserve lost varies between people and between different organs in a single person.These changes appear slowly and over a long period. When an organ is worked harder than usual, it may not be able to increase function. Sudden heart failure or other problems can develop when the body is worked harder than usual. Things that produce an extra workload (body stressors) include the following:IllnessMedicinesOveractive thyroid glandSignificant life changesSudden increased physical demands on the body, such as a change in activity or exposure to a higher altitudeLoss of reserve also makes it harder to restore balance (equilibrium) in the body. Drugs are removed from the body by the kidneys and liver at a slower rate. Lower doses of medicines may be needed, and side effects become more common. Recovery from illnesses is seldom 100%, leading to more and more disability.Side effects of medicine can mimic the symptoms of many diseases, so it is easy to mistake a drug reaction for an illness. Some medicines have entirely different side effects in the elderly than in younger people.AGING THEORYNo one knows how and why people change as they get older. Some theories claim that aging is caused by injuries from ultraviolet light over time, wear and tear on the body, or byproducts of metabolism. Other theories view aging as a predetermined process controlled by genes.No single process can explain all the changes of aging. Aging is a complex process that varies as to how it affects different people and even different organs. Most gerontologists (people who study aging) feel that aging is due to the interaction of many lifelong influences. These influences include heredity, environment, culture, diet, exercise and leisure, past illnesses, and many other factors.Unlike the changes of adolescence, which are predictable to within a few years, each person ages at a unique rate. Some systems begin aging as early as age 30. Other aging processes are not common until much later in life.Although some changes always occur with aging, they occur at different rates and to different extents. There is no way to predict exactly how you will age.TERMS TO DESCRIBE TYPES OF CELL CHANGESAtrophy:Cells shrink. If enough cells decrease in size, the entire organ atrophies. This is often a normal aging change and can occur in any tissue. It is most common in skeletal muscle, the heart, the brain, and the sex organs (such as the breasts and ovaries). Bones become thinner and more likely to break with minor trauma.The cause of atrophy is unknown, but may include reduced use, decreased workload, decreased blood supply or nutrition to the cells, and reduced stimulation by nerves or hormones.Hypertrophy:Cells enlarge. This is caused by an increase of proteins in the cell membrane and cell structures, not an increase in the cell's fluid.When some cells atrophy, others may hypertrophy to make up for the loss of cell mass. Hyperplasia:The number of cells increases. There is an increased rate of cell division.Hyperplasia usually occurs to compensate for a loss of cells. It allows some organs and tissues to regenerate, including the skin, lining of the intestines, liver, and bone marrow. The liver is especially good at regeneration. It can replace up to 70% of its structure within 2 weeks after an injury.Tissues that have limited ability to regenerate include bone, cartilage, and smooth muscle (such as the muscles around the intestines). Ongoing research suggests that tissues previously thought to have limited or no ability to regenerate - nerves, skeletal muscle, heart muscle, and the lens of the eye - may have some regenerative ability. But in most cases we have not yet learned how to harness this ability for medical treatment. Dysplasia:The size, shape, or organization of mature cells becomes abnormal. This is also called atypical hyperplasia.Dysplasia is fairly common in the cells of the cervix and the lining of the respiratory tract.Neoplasia:The formation of tumors, either cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign).Neoplastic cells often reproduce quickly. They may have unusual shapes and abnormal function.As you grow older, you will have changes throughout your body, including changes in your:Hormone productionImmunitySkinSleepBones, muscles, and jointsBreastsFaceReproductive systemHeart and blood vesselsKidneysLungsNervous system",

Aging changes in sleep,"Sleep normally occurs in several stages. The sleep cycle includes:Dreamless periods of light and deep sleepSome periods of active dreaming (REM sleep) The sleep cycle is repeated several times during the night.AGING CHANGESSleep patterns tend to change as you age. Most people find that aging causes them to have a harder time falling asleep. They wake up more often during the night and earlier in the morning.Total sleep time stays the same or is slightly decreased (6.5 to 7 hours per night). It may be harder to fall asleep and you may spend more total time in bed. The transition between sleep and waking up is often abrupt, which makes older people feel like they are a lighter sleeper than when they were younger.Less time is spent in deep, dreamless sleep. Older people wake up an average of 3 or 4 times each night. They are also more aware of being awake.Older people wake up more often because they spend less time deep sleep. Other causes include needing to get up and urinate (nocturia), anxiety, and discomfort or pain from long-term (chronic) illnesses.EFFECT OF CHANGESSleep difficulty is an annoying problem. Long-term (chronic) insomnia is a major cause of auto accidents and depression. Because older people sleep more lightly and wake up more often, they may feel deprived of sleep even when their total sleep time has not changed.Sleep deprivation can eventually cause confusion and other mental changes. It is treatable, though. You can reduce symptoms when you get enough sleep.Sleep problems are also a common symptom of depression. See a health care provider to find out whether depression or another health condition is affecting your sleep.COMMON PROBLEMSInsomnia is one of the more common sleep problems in older people.Other sleep disorders, such as restless legs syndrome, narcolepsy, or hypersomnia can also occur.Sleep apnea, a condition where breathing stops for a time during sleep, can cause severe problems. PREVENTIONOlder people respond differently to medicines than do younger adults. It is very important to talk with your provider before taking sleep medicines. If possible, avoid sleep medicines. However, antidepressant medicines can be very helpful if depression affects your sleep. Some antidepressants do not cause the same side effects as sleep medicines.Sometimes, a mild antihistamine works better than a sleeping pill for relieving short-term insomnia. However, most health experts do not recommend these types of medicines for older people.Use sleep medicines (such as zolpidem, zaleplon, eszoplicone or benzodiazepines) only as recommended, and only for a short time. Some of these medicines can lead to dependence (needing to take the drug to function) or addiction (compulsive use despite adverse consequences). Some of these drugs build up in your body. You can develop toxic effects such as confusion, delirium, and falls if you take them for a long time.You can take measures to help you sleep:A light bedtime snack may be helpful. Many people find that warm milk increases sleepiness, because it contains a natural, sedative-like amino acid.Avoid stimulants such as caffeine (found in coffee, tea, cola drinks, and chocolate) for at least 3 or 4 hours before bed.Do not take naps during the day.Exercise at regular times each day, but not within 3 hours of your bedtime.Avoid too much stimulation, such as violent TV shows or computer games, before sleep. Practice relaxation techniques at bedtime.Do not watch television or use your computer, cell phone, or tablet in the bedroom.Try to go to bed at the same time every night and wake at the same time each morning.Use the bed only for sleep or sexual activity.Avoid tobacco products, especially before sleep.Ask your provider if any of the medicines you take may affect your sleep. If you cannot fall asleep after 20 minutes, get out of bed and do a quiet activity, such as reading or listening to music.When you feel sleepy, get back in bed and try again. If you still cannot fall asleep in 20 minutes, repeat the process.Drinking alcohol at bedtime may make you sleepy. However, it is best to avoid alcohol, because it can make you wake up later in the night.RELATED TOPICSAging changes in the nervous systemInsomnia",
Aging changes in teeth and gums,"Aging changes occur in all of the body's cells, tissues, and organs. These changes affect all parts of the body, including the teeth and gums. Certain health conditions that are more common in older adults taking certain medicines can also affect oral health. Learn what you can do to keep your teeth and gums healthy in your later years.",Dental hygiene - aging; Teeth - aging; Oral hygiene - aging
Aging changes in the bones - muscles - joints,"Changes in posture and gait (walking pattern) are common with aging.The skeleton provides support and structure to the body. Joints are the areas where bones come together. They allow the skeleton to be flexible for movement. In a joint, bones do not directly contact each other. Instead, they are cushioned by cartilage in the joint, synovial membranes around the joint, and fluid.Muscles provide the force and strength to move the body. Coordination is directed by the brain, but is affected by changes in the muscles and joints. Changes in the muscles, joints, and bones affect the posture and walk, and lead to weakness and slowed movement.AGING CHANGESPeople lose bone mass or density as they age, especially women after menopause. The bones lose calcium and other minerals.The spine is made up of bones called vertebrae. Between each bone is a gel-like cushion (called a disk). With aging, the middle of the body (trunk) becomes shorter as the disks gradually lose fluid and become thinner.Vertebrae also lose some of their mineral content, making each bone thinner. The spinal column becomes curved and compressed (packed together). Bone spurs caused by aging and overall use of the spine may also form on the vertebrae.The foot arches become less pronounced, contributing to a slight loss of height.The long bones of the arms and legs are more brittle because of mineral loss, but they do not change length. This makes the arms and legs look longer when compared with the shortened trunk.The joints become stiffer and less flexible. Fluid in the joints may decrease. The cartilage may begin to rub together and wear away. Minerals may deposit in and around some joints (calcification). This is common around the shoulder.Hip and knee joints may begin to lose cartilage (degenerative changes). The finger joints lose cartilage and the bones thicken slightly. Finger joint changes, most often bony swelling called osteophytes, are more common in women. These changes may be inherited.Lean body mass decreases. This decrease is partly caused by a loss of muscle tissue (atrophy). The speed and amount of muscle changes seem to be caused by genes. Muscle changes often begin in the 20s in men and in the 40s in women.Lipofuscin (an age-related pigment) and fat are deposited in muscle tissue. The muscle fibers shrink. Muscle tissue is replaced more slowly. Lost muscle tissue may be replaced with a tough fibrous tissue. This is most noticeable in the hands, which may look thin and bony.Muscles are less toned and less able to contract because of changes in the muscle tissue and normal aging changes in the nervous system. Muscles may become rigid with age and may lose tone, even with regular exercise.EFFECT OF CHANGESBones become more brittle and may break more easily. Overall height decreases, mainly because the trunk and spine shorten.Breakdown of the joints may lead to inflammation, pain, stiffness, and deformity. Joint changes affect almost all older people. These changes range from minor stiffness to severe arthritis.The posture may become more stooped (bent). The knees and hips may become more flexed. The neck may tilt, and the shoulders may narrow while the pelvis becomes wider.Movement slows and may become limited. The walking pattern (gait) becomes slower and shorter. Walking may become unsteady, and there is less arm swinging. Older people get tired more easily and have less energy.Strength and endurance change. Loss of muscle mass reduces strength.COMMON PROBLEMSOsteoporosis is a common problem, especially for older women. Bones break more easily. Compression fractures of the vertebrae can cause pain and reduce mobility.Muscle weakness contributes to fatigue, weakness, and reduced activity tolerance. Joint problems ranging from mild stiffness to debilitating arthritis (osteoarthritis) are very common.The risk of injury increases because gait changes, instability, and loss of balance may lead to falls.Some older people have reduced reflexes. This is most often caused by changes in the muscles and tendons, rather than changes in the nerves. Decreased knee jerk or ankle jerk reflexes can occur. Some changes, such as a positive Babinski reflex, are not a normal part of aging.Involuntary movements (muscle tremors and fine movements called fasciculations) are more common in the older people. Older people who are not active may have weakness or abnormal sensations (paresthesias).People who are unable to move on their own, or who do not stretch their muscles with exercise, may get muscle contractures.PREVENTIONExercise is one of the best ways to slow or prevent problems with the muscles, joints, and bones. A moderate exercise program can help you maintain strength, balance, and flexibility. Exercise helps the bones stay strong.Talk to your health care provider before starting a new exercise program.It is important to eat a well-balanced diet with plenty of calcium. Women need to be particularly careful to get enough calcium and vitamin D as they age. Postmenopausal women and men over age 70 should take in 1,200 mg of calcium per day. Women and men over age 70 should get 800 international units (IU) of vitamin D daily. If you have osteoporosis, talk to your provider about prescription treatments.RELATED TOPICSAging changes in body shapeAging changes in hormone productionAging changes in organs, tissues, and cellsAging changes in the nervous systemCalcium in dietOsteoporosis",
Aging changes in the breast,"With age, a woman's breasts lose fat, tissue, and mammary glands. Many of these changes are due to the decrease in the body's production of estrogen that occurs at menopause. Without estrogen, the gland tissue shrinks, making the breasts smaller and less full. The connective tissue that supports the breasts becomes less elastic, so the breasts sag.Changes also occur in the nipple. The area surrounding the nipple (the areola) becomes smaller and may nearly disappear. The nipple may also turn in slightly.Breast lumps are common around the time of menopause. These are usually noncancerous cysts. However, if you notice a lump, make an appointment with your health care provider, because breast cancer risk increases with age. Women should be aware of the benefits and limitations of breast self-exams. These exams do not always pick up early stages of breast cancer. Women should talk to their providers about regular physical examinations and mammogram to screen for breast cancer.",
Aging changes in the face,"The appearance of the face and neck typically changes with age. Loss of muscle tone and thinning skin gives the face a flabby or drooping appearance. In some people, sagging jowls may create the look of a double chin. Your skin also dries out and the underlying layer of fat shrinks so that your face no longer has a plump, smooth surface. To some extent, wrinkles cannot be avoided. However, sun exposure and cigarette smoking are likely to make them develop more quickly. The number and size of blotches and dark spots on the face increase as well. These pigment changes are largely due to sun exposure. Missing teeth and receding gums change the appearance of the mouth, so your lips may look shrunken. Loss of bone mass in the jaw reduces the size of the lower face and makes your forehead, nose, and mouth more pronounced. Your nose may also lengthen slightly.The ears may lengthen in some people (probably caused by cartilage growth). Men may develop hair in their ears that becomes longer, coarser, and more noticeable as they age. Ear wax becomes drier because there are fewer wax glands in the ears and they produce less oil. The hardened ear wax can block the ear canal and affect your ability to hear. Eyebrows and eyelashes turn gray. As in other parts of the face, the skin around the eyes gets wrinkles, creating crow's feet at the side of the eyes.Fat from the eyelids settles into the eye sockets. This can make your eyes look sunken. The lower eyelids can slacken and bags can develop under your eyes. Weakening of the muscle that supports the upper eyelid can make the eyelids droop. This may limit vision.The outer surface of the eye (cornea) may develop a grayish-white ring. The colored portion of the eye (iris) loses pigment, making most very older people appear to have gray or light blue eyes.",
Aging changes in the female reproductive system,"Aging changes in the female reproductive system result mainly from changing hormone levels. One clear sign of aging occurs when your menstrual periods stop permanently. This is known as menopause.The time before menopause is called perimenopause. It may begin several years before your last menstrual period. Signs of perimenopause include:More frequent periods at first, and then occasional missed periodsPeriods that are longer or shorterChanges in the amount of menstrual flowEventually your periods will become much less frequent, until they stop completely.Along with changes in your periods, physical changes in your reproductive tract occur as well.AGING CHANGES AND THEIR EFFECTSMenopause is a normal part of a woman's aging process. Most women experience menopause around age 50, though it can occur before that age. The usual age range is 45 to 55.With menopause:The ovaries stop making the hormones estrogen and progesterone.The ovaries also stop releasing eggs (ova, oocytes). After menopause, you can no longer become pregnant.Your menstrual periods stop. You know you have gone through menopause after you have had no periods for 1 year. You should continue to use a birth control method until you have gone a whole year without a period. Any bleeding that occurs more than 1 year after your last period is not normal and should be checked by your health care provider.As hormone levels fall, other changes occur in the reproductive system, including:Vaginal walls become thinner, dryer, less elastic, and possibly irritated. Sometimes sex becomes painful due to these vaginal changes.Your risk for vaginal yeast infections increases.The external genital tissue decreases and thins, and can become irritated.Other common changes include:Menopause symptoms such as hot flashes, moodiness, headaches, and trouble sleeping, which can persist for yearsProblems with short-term memoryDecrease in breast tissueLower sex drive (libido) and sexual responseIncreased risk for bone loss (osteoporosis)Urinary system changes, such as frequency and urgency of urination and increased risk for urinary tract infectionLoss of tone in the pubic muscles, resulting in the vagina, uterus, or urinary bladder falling out of position (prolapse)MANAGING CHANGESHormone therapy with estrogen or progesterone, alone or in combination, may help menopause symptoms such as hot flashes or vaginal dryness and pain with intercourse. Most women who have a uterus will require progesterone as well as estrogen. Women without a uterus may take estrogen only. Hormone therapy has risks, so it is not for every woman. Discuss the risks and benefits of hormone therapy with your provider.To help manage problems such as painful sexual intercourse, use a lubricant during sexual intercourse. Vaginal moisturizers are available without a prescription. These can help with vaginal and vulvar discomfort due to the drying and thinning of tissues. Applying topical estrogen inside the vagina may help thicken the vaginal tissues and increase moisture and sensitivity. Your provider can tell you if any of these measures is right for you.Getting regular exercise, eating healthy foods, and staying involved in activities with friends and loved ones can help the aging process go more smoothly.OTHER CHANGESOther aging changes to expect:Hormone productionOrgans, tissues, and cellsBreastsKidneys",
Aging changes in the heart and blood vessels,"Some changes in the heart and blood vessels normally occur with age. However, many other changes that are common with aging are due to or worsened by modifiable factors. If not treated, these can lead to heart disease.BACKGROUNDThe heart has two sides. The right side pumps blood to the lungs to receive oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide. The left side pumps oxygen-rich blood to the body.Blood flows out of the heart, first through the aorta, and then through arteries, which branch out and get smaller and smaller as they go into the tissues. In the tissues, they become tiny capillaries.Capillaries are where the blood gives up (releases) oxygen and nutrients to the tissues, and receives carbon dioxide and wastes back from the tissues. Then, the vessels begin to collect together into larger and larger veins, which return blood to the heart.Watch this video about:Blood flowAGING CHANGESHeart: The heart has a natural pacemaker system that controls the heartbeat. Some of the pathways of this system may develop fibrous tissue and fat deposits. The natural pacemaker (the sinoatrial or SA node) loses some of its cells. These changes may result in a slightly slower heart rate.A slight increase in the size of the heart, especially the left ventricle occurs in some people. The heart wall thickens, so the amount of blood that the chamber can hold may actually decrease despite the increased overall heart size. The heart may fill more slowly.Heart changes often cause the electrocardiogram (ECG) of a normal, healthy older person to be slightly different than the ECG of a healthy younger adult. Abnormal rhythms (arrhythmias), such as atrial fibrillation, are more common in older people. They may be caused by several types of heart disease.Normal changes in the heart include deposits of the ""aging pigment,"" lipofuscin. The heart muscle cells degenerate slightly. The valves inside the heart, which control the direction of blood flow, thicken and become stiffer. A heart murmur caused by valve stiffness is fairly common in older people. Blood vessels: Receptors called baroreceptors monitor the blood pressure and make changes to help maintain a fairly constant blood pressure when a person changes positions or is doing other activities. The baroreceptors become less sensitive with aging. This may explain why many older people have orthostatic hypotension, a condition in which the blood pressure falls when a person goes from lying or sitting to standing. This causes dizziness because there is less blood flow to the brain.The capillary walls thicken slightly. This may cause a slightly slower rate of exchange of nutrients and wastes.The main artery from the heart (aorta) becomes thicker, stiffer, and less flexible. This is probably related to changes in the connective tissue of the blood vessel wall. This makes the blood pressure higher and makes the heart work harder, which may lead to thickening of the heart muscle (hypertrophy). The other arteries also thicken and stiffen. In general, most older people have a moderate increase in blood pressure. Blood: The blood itself changes slightly with age. Normal aging causes a reduction in total body water. As part of this, there is less fluid in the bloodstream, so blood volume decreases.The speed with which red blood cells are produced in response to stress or illness is reduced. This creates a slower response to blood loss and anemia.Most of the white blood cells stay at the same levels, although certain white blood cells important to immunity (neutrophils) decrease in their number and ability to fight off bacteria. This reduces the ability to resist infection. EFFECT OF CHANGESNormally, the heart continues to pump enough blood to supply all parts of the body. However, an older heart may not be able to pump blood as well when you make it work harder.Some of the things that make your heart work harder are:Certain medicinesEmotional stressPhysical exertionIllnessInfectionsInjuries COMMON PROBLEMSAngina (chest pain caused by temporarily reduced blood flow to the heart muscle), shortness of breath with exertion, and heart attack can result from coronary artery disease.Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) of various types can occur.Anemia may occur, possibly related to malnutrition, chronic infections, blood loss from the gastrointestinal tract, or as a complication of other diseases or medicines.Atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) is very common. Fatty plaque deposits inside the blood vessels cause them to narrow and may totally block blood vessels.Congestive heart failure is also very common in older people. In people older than 75, congestive heart failure occurs 10 times more often than in younger adults.Coronary artery disease is fairly common. It is usually a result of atherosclerosis.High blood pressure and orthostatic hypotension are more common with older age. Older people on blood pressure medicines need to work with their doctor to find the best way to manage their high blood pressure. This is because too much medicine may cause low blood pressure and could lead to a fall.Heart valve diseases are fairly common. Aortic stenosis, or narrowing of the aortic valve, is the most common valve disease in older adults.Transient ischemic attacks (TIA) or strokes can occur if blood flow to the brain is disrupted. Other problems with the heart and blood vessels include the following:Blood clotsDeep vein thrombosisThrombophlebitisPeripheral vascular disease, resulting in intermittent pain in the legs when walking (claudication)Varicose veinsAneurysms may develop in one of the major arteries from the heart or in the brain. Aneurysms are an abnormal widening or ballooning of a part of an artery due to weakness in the wall of the blood vessel. If an aneurysm bursts it may cause bleeding and death. PREVENTIONYou can help your circulatory system (heart and blood vessels). Heart disease risk factors that you have some control over include high blood pressure, cholesterol levels, diabetes, obesity, and smoking.Eat a heart-healthy diet with reduced amounts of saturated fat and cholesterol, and control your weight. Follow your health care provider's recommendations for treating high blood pressure, high cholesterol or diabetes. Reduce or stop smoking.Men age 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked should be screened for aneurysms in their abdominal aorta usually with an ultrasound exam. Get more exercise:Exercise may help prevent obesity, and it helps people with diabetes control their blood sugar.Exercise may help you maintain your abilities as much as possible, and it reduces stress.Moderate exercise is one of the best things you can do to keep your heart, and the rest of your body, healthy. Consult with your provider before beginning a new exercise program. Exercise moderately and within your capabilities, but do it regularly.People who exercise often have less body fat and smoke less than people who do not exercise. They also tend to have fewer blood pressure problems and less heart disease. Have regular check-ups for your heart:Have your blood pressure checked every year. If you have diabetes, heart disease, kidney problems, or certain other conditions, your blood pressure may need to be monitored more closely.If your cholesterol level is normal, have it rechecked every 5 years. If you have diabetes, heart disease, kidney problems, or certain other conditions, your cholesterol may need to be monitored more closely.",
Aging changes in the kidneys and bladder,"The kidneys filter the blood and help remove wastes and extra fluid from the body. The kidneys also help control the body's chemical balance. The kidneys are part of the urinary system, which also includes the ureters, bladder, and urethra.Muscle changes and changes in the reproductive system can affect bladder control.AGING CHANGES AND THEIR EFFECTS ON THE KIDNEYS AND BLADDERAs you age, your kidneys and bladder change. This can affect their function.Changes in the kidneys that occur with age:Amount of kidney tissue decreases and kidney function diminishes.Number of filtering units (nephrons) decreases. Nephrons filter waste material from the blood.Blood vessels supplying the kidneys can become hardened. This causes the kidneys to filter blood more slowly. Changes in the bladder:The bladder wall changes. The elastic tissue becomes stiffer and the bladder becomes less stretchy. The bladder cannot hold as much urine as before.The bladder muscles weaken.The urethra can become partially or totally blocked. In women, this can be due to weakened muscles that cause the bladder or vagina to fall out of position (prolapse). In men, the urethra can become blocked by an enlarged prostate gland. In a healthy aging person, kidney function declines very slowly. Illness, medicines, and other conditions can significantly degrade kidney function. COMMON PROBLEMSAging increases the risk of kidney and bladder problems such as:Bladder control issues, such as leakage or urinary incontinence (not being able to hold your urine), or urinary retention (not being able to completely empty your bladder)Bladder and other urinary tract infections (UTIs)Chronic kidney disease WHEN TO CONTACT A MEDICAL PROFESSIONALContact your health care provider right away if you have any of the following:Signs of a urinary tract infection, including fever or chills, burning when urinating, nausea and vomiting, extreme tiredness, or flank painVery dark urine or fresh blood in the urineTrouble urinatingUrinating more often than usual (polyuria)Sudden need to urinate (urinary urgency) As you grow older, you will have other changes, including: In the bones, muscles, and jointsIn the male reproductive systemIn the female reproductive systemIn organs, tissues, and cells",
Aging changes in the lungs,"The lungs have two main functions. One is to get oxygen from the air into the body. The other is to remove carbon dioxide from the body. Your body needs oxygen to work properly. Carbon dioxide is a gas your body produces when it uses oxygen.Watch this video about:BreathingDuring breathing, air enters and exits the lungs. When you breathe in (inhale), air flows through the airways into the lungs. The airways are made of stretchy tissue. Bands of muscle and other support tissue wrap around each airway to help keep them open.Air keeps flowing into the lungs until it fills tiny air sacs called alveoli. Blood circulates around these air sacs through tiny blood vessels called capillaries. Oxygen crosses into the bloodstream at the place where the blood vessels and air sacs meet. This is also where carbon dioxide crosses from the bloodstream into the lungs to be breathed out (exhaled).Watch this video about:Gas exchangeAGING CHANGES IN YOUR BODY AND THEIR EFFECTS ON THE LUNGSChanges to the bones and muscles of the chest and spine:Bones become thinner and change shape. This can change the shape of your ribcage. As a result, your ribcage may not expand and contract as well during breathing.The muscle that supports your breathing, the diaphragm, becomes weakened. This weakness may prevent you from breathing enough air in or out. These changes in your bones and muscles may lower the oxygen level in your body. Also, less carbon dioxide may be removed from your body. Symptoms such as tiredness and shortness of breath can result.Changes to lung tissue:Muscles and other tissues that are near your airways may lose their ability to keep the airways completely open. This causes the airways to close easily.Aging also causes the air sacs to lose their shape and become baggy. These changes in lung tissue can allow air to get trapped in your lungs. Too little oxygen may enter your blood vessels and less carbon dioxide may be removed. This makes it hard to breathe.Changes to the nervous system:The part of the brain that controls breathing may lose some of its function. When this happens, your lungs are not able to get enough oxygen. Not enough carbon dioxide may leave the lungs. Breathing may get more difficult.Nerves in your airways that trigger coughing become less sensitive. Large amounts of particles like smoke or germs may collect in the lungs and may be hard to cough up. Changes to the immune system: Your immune system can get weaker. This means your body is less able to fight lung infections and other diseases.Your lungs are also less able to recover after exposure to smoke or other harmful particles. COMMON PROBLEMSAs a result of these changes, older people are at increased risk for:Lung infections, such as pneumonia and bronchitisShortness of breathLow oxygen levelAbnormal breathing patterns, resulting in problems such as sleep apnea (episodes of stopped breathing during sleep) PREVENTIONTo decrease the effects of aging on the lungs:Do not smoke. Avoid exposure to cigarette smoke. Smoking and smoke exposure harm the lungs and speeds up lung aging.Do physical exercise to improve lung function.Get up and move. Lying in bed or sitting for long periods allows mucus to collect in the lungs. This puts you at risk of lung infections. This is especially true right after surgery or when you are ill. OTHER CHANGES RELATED TO AGINGAs you grow older, you will have other changes, including: In organs, tissues, and cellsIn the bones, muscles, and jointsIn the heart and blood vesselsIn vital signs",
Aging changes in the male reproductive system,"Aging changes in the male reproductive system may include changes in testicular tissue, sperm production, and erectile function. These changes usually occur gradually.",Andropause; Male reproductive changes
Aging changes in the nervous system,"The brain and nervous system are your body's central control center. They control your body's: MovementsSensesThoughts and memories They also help control the organs such as your heart and bowels.Nerves are the pathways that carry signals to and from your brain and the rest of your body. The spinal cord is the bundle of nerves that runs from your brain down the center of your back. Nerves extend out from the spinal cord to every part of your body. AGING CHANGES AND THEIR EFFECTS ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM As you age, your brain and nervous system go through natural changes. Your brain and spinal cord lose nerve cells and weight (atrophy). Nerve cells may begin to pass messages more slowly than in the past. Waste products or other chemicals such as beta amyloid can collect in the brain tissue as nerve cells break down. This can cause abnormal changes in the brain called plaques and tangles to form. A fatty brown pigment (lipofuscin) can also build up in nerve tissue.Breakdown of nerves can affect your senses. You might have reduced or lost reflexes or sensation. This leads to problems with movement and safety and makes it more likely to suffer falls.Slowing of thought, memory, and thinking is a normal part of aging. These changes are not the same in everyone. Some people have many changes in their nerves and brain tissue. Others have few changes. These changes are not always related to the effects on your ability to think. NERVOUS SYSTEM PROBLEMS IN OLDER PEOPLEDementia and severe memory loss are not a normal part of aging. They can be caused by brain diseases such as Alzheimer disease, which doctors believe is associated with plaques and tangles forming in the brain.Delirium is sudden confusion that leads to changes in thinking and behavior. It is often due to illnesses that are not related to the brain. Infection can cause an older person to become severely confused. Certain medicines can also cause or complicate this.Thinking and behavior problems can also be caused by poorly controlled diabetes. Rising and falling blood sugar levels can interfere with thought.Talk with your health care provider if you have any changes in: MemoryThoughtAbility to perform a task Seek medical help right away if these symptoms occur suddenly or along with other symptoms. A change in thinking, memory, or behavior is important if it is different from your normal patterns or it affects your lifestyle. PREVENTION Mental and physical exercise can help your brain stay sharp. Mental exercises include: ReadingDoing crossword puzzlesStimulating conversation Physical exercise promotes blood flow to your brain. It also helps reduce loss of brain cells. OTHER CHANGESAs you grow older, you will have other changes, including: In organs, tissues, and cellsIn the heart and blood vesselsIn the vital signsIn the senses",
Aging changes in the senses,"As you age, the way your senses (hearing, vision, taste, smell, touch) give you information about the world changes. Your senses become less sharp, and this can make it harder for you to notice details.Sensory changes can affect your lifestyle. You may have problems communicating, enjoying activities, and staying involved with people. Sensory changes can lead to isolation.Your senses receive information from your environment. This information can be in the form of sound, light, smells, tastes, and touch. Sensory information is converted into nerve signals that are carried to the brain. There, the signals are turned into meaningful sensations.A certain amount of stimulation is required before you become aware of a sensation. This minimum level of sensation is called the threshold. Aging raises this threshold. You need more stimulation to be aware of the sensation.Aging can affect all of the senses, but usually hearing and vision are most affected. Devices such as glasses and hearing aids, or lifestyle changes can improve your ability to hear and see.HEARINGYour ears have two jobs. One is hearing and the other is maintaining balance. Hearing occurs after sound vibrations cross the eardrum to the inner ear. The vibrations are changed into nerve signals in the inner ear and are carried to the brain by the auditory nerve.Watch this video about:Hearing and the cochleaBalance (equilibrium) is controlled in the inner ear. Fluid and small hair in the inner ear stimulate the auditory nerve. This helps the brain maintain balance.As you age, structures inside the ear start to change and their functions decline. Your ability to pick up sounds decreases. You may also have problems maintaining your balance as you sit, stand, and walk.Age-related hearing loss is called presbycusis. It affects both ears equally. Hearing, particularly the ability to hear high-frequency sounds, may decline. You may also have trouble telling the difference between certain sounds. Or, you may have problems hearing a conversation when there is background noise. If you are having trouble hearing, discuss your symptoms with your health care provider. One way to manage hearing loss is by getting fitted with hearing aids.Persistent, abnormal ear noise (tinnitus) is another common problem in older adults. Causes of tinnitus may include wax buildup, medicines that damage structures inside the ear or mild hearing loss. If you have tinnitus, ask your provider how to manage the condition.Impacted ear wax can also cause trouble hearing and is common with age. Your provider can remove impacted ear wax.VISIONVision occurs when light is processed by your eye and interpreted by your brain. Light passes through the transparent eye surface (cornea). It continues through the pupil, the opening to the inside of the eye. The pupil becomes larger or smaller to control the amount of light that enters the eye. The colored part of the eye is called the iris. It is a muscle that controls pupil size. After light passes through your pupil, it reaches the lens. The lens focuses light on your retina (the back of the eye). The retina converts light energy into a nerve signal that the optic nerve carries to the brain, where it is interpreted.Watch this video about:SeeingAll of the eye structures change with aging. The cornea becomes less sensitive, so you might not notice eye injuries. By the time you turn 60, your pupils may decrease to about one third of the size they were when you were 20. The pupils may react more slowly in response to darkness or bright light. The lens becomes yellowed, less flexible, and slightly cloudy leading to the development of cataracts. The fat pads supporting the eyes decrease and the eyes sink into their sockets. The eye muscles become less able to fully rotate the eye.As you age, the sharpness of your vision (visual acuity) gradually declines. The most common problem is difficulty focusing the eyes on close-up objects. This condition is called presbyopia. Reading glasses, bifocal glasses, or contact lenses can help correct presbyopia.You may be less able to tolerate glare. For example, glare from a shiny floor in a sunlit room can make it difficult to get around indoors. You may have trouble adapting to darkness or bright light. Problems with glare, brightness, and darkness may cause problems driving at night.As you age, it gets harder to tell blues from greens than it is to tell reds from yellows. Using warm contrasting colors (yellow, orange, and red) in your home can improve your ability to see. Keeping a red light on in darkened rooms, such as the hallway or bathroom, makes it easier to see than using a regular night light.With aging, the gel-like substance (vitreous) inside your eye starts to shrink. This can create small particles called floaters in your field of vision. In most cases, floaters do not reduce your vision. But if you develop floaters suddenly or have a rapid increase in the number of floaters, you should have your eyes checked by a professional, as this may indicate a retinal detachment.Reduced peripheral vision (side vision) is common in older people. This can limit your activity and ability to interact with others. It may be hard to communicate with people sitting next to you because you cannot see them well. Driving can become dangerous.Weakened eye muscles may prevent you from moving your eyes in all directions. It may be hard to look upward. The area in which objects can be seen (visual field) gets smaller.Aging eyes also may not produce enough tears. This leads to dry eyes which may be uncomfortable. When dry eyes are not treated, infection, inflammation, and scarring of the cornea can occur. You can relieve dry eyes by using eye drops or artificial tears.The upper eyelids may sag because of weakened muscular support. This may lead to visual loss if the sagging is severe.Common eye disorders that cause vision changes that are NOT normal include:Cataracts -- clouding of the lens of the eyeGlaucoma -- rise in fluid pressure in the eyeMacular degeneration -- disease in the macula (responsible for central vision) that causes vision lossRetinopathy -- disease in the retina often caused by diabetes or high blood pressure If you are having vision problems, discuss your symptoms with your provider.TASTE AND SMELLThe senses of taste and smell work together. Most tastes are linked with odors. The sense of smell begins at the nerve endings high in the lining of the nose.Watch this video about:SmellingYou have about 10,000 taste buds. Your taste buds sense sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami flavors. Umami is a taste linked with foods that contain glutamate, such as the seasoning monosodium glutamate (MSG).Watch this video about:TastingSmell and taste play a role in food enjoyment and safety. A delicious meal or pleasant aroma can improve social interaction and enjoyment of life. Smell and taste also allow you to detect danger, such as spoiled food, gases, and smoke.The number of taste buds decreases as you age. Each remaining taste bud also begins to shrink. Sensitivity to the five tastes often declines after age 60. In addition, your mouth produces less saliva as you age. This can cause dry mouth, which can affect your sense of taste.Your sense of smell can also diminish, especially after age 70. This may be related to a loss of nerve endings and less mucus production in the nose. Mucus helps odors stay in the nose long enough to be detected by the nerve endings. It also helps clear odors from the nerve endings.Certain things can speed up the loss of taste and smell. These include diseases, smoking, and exposure to harmful particles in the air.Decreased taste and smell can lessen your interest and enjoyment in eating. You may not be able to sense certain dangers if you cannot smell odors such as natural gas or smoke from a fire.If your senses of taste and smell have diminished, talk to your provider. The following may help:Switch to a different medicine, if the medicine you take is affecting your ability to smell and taste.Use different spices or change the way you prepare food.Buy safety products, such as a gas detector that sounds an alarm you can hear. TOUCH, VIBRATION, AND PAINThe sense of touch makes you aware of pain, temperature, pressure, vibration, and body position. Skin, muscles, tendons, joints, and internal organs have nerve endings (receptors) that detect these sensations. Some receptors give the brain information about the position and condition of internal organs. Though you may not be aware of this information, it helps to identify changes (for example, the pain of appendicitis).Your brain interprets the type and amount of touch sensation. It also interprets the sensation as pleasant (such as being comfortably warm), unpleasant (such as being very hot), or neutral (such as being aware that you are touching something).Watch this video about:Feeling painWith aging, sensations may be reduced or changed. These changes can occur because of decreased blood flow to the nerve endings or to the spinal cord or brain. The spinal cord transmits nerve signals and the brain interprets these signals.Health problems, such as a lack of certain nutrients, can also cause sensation changes. Brain surgery, problems in the brain, confusion, and nerve damage from injury or long-term (chronic) diseases such as diabetes can also result in sensation changes.Symptoms of changed sensation vary based on the cause. With decreased temperature sensitivity, it can be hard to tell the difference between cool and cold and hot and warm. This can increase the risk of injury from frostbite, hypothermia (dangerously low body temperature), and burns.Reduced ability to detect vibration, touch, and pressure increases the risk of injuries, including pressure ulcers (skin sores that develop when pressure cuts off blood supply to the area). After age 50, many people have reduced sensitivity to pain. Or, you may feel and recognize pain, but it does not bother you. For example, when you are injured, you may not know how severe the injury is because the pain does not trouble you.You may develop problems walking because of reduced ability to perceive where your body is in relation to the floor. This increases your risk of falling, a common problem for older people.Older people can become more sensitive to light touches because their skin is thinner.If you have noticed changes in touch, pain, or problems standing or walking, talk with your provider. There may be ways to manage the symptoms.The following measures can help you stay safe:Lower the water heater temperature to no higher than 120°F (49°C) to avoid burns.Check the thermometer to decide how to dress, rather than waiting until you feel overheated or chilled.Inspect your skin, especially your feet, for injuries. If you find an injury, treat it. Do not assume the injury is not serious because the area is not painful. OTHER CHANGESAs you grow older, you will have other changes, including:In organs, tissues, and cellsIn skinIn the bones, muscles, and jointsIn the faceIn the nervous system",
Aging changes in vital signs,"Vital signs include body temperature, heart rate (pulse), breathing (respiratory) rate, and blood pressure. As you age, your vital signs may change, depending on how healthy you are. Some medical problems can cause changes in one or more vital signs.Checking your vital signs helps your health care provider monitor your health and any medical problems you may have.BODY TEMPERATURE Normal body temperature does not change much with aging. But as you get older, it becomes harder for your body to control its temperature. A decrease in the amount of fat below the skin makes it harder to stay warm. You may need to wear layers of clothing to feel warm.Aging decreases your ability to sweat. You may have difficulty telling when you are becoming overheated. This puts you at high risk of overheating (heat stroke). You can also be at risk for dangerous drops in body temperature.Fever is an important sign of illness in older people. It is often the only symptom for several days of an illness. See your provider if you have a fever that is not explained by a known illness.A fever is also a sign of infection. When an older person has an infection, their body may not be able to produce a higher temperature. For this reason, it is important to check other vital signs, as well as any symptoms and signs of infection.HEART RATE AND BREATHING RATE As you grow older, your pulse rate is about the same as before. But when you exercise, it may take longer for your pulse to increase and longer for it to slow down afterward. Your highest heart rate with exercise is also lower than it was when you were younger.Breathing rate usually does not change with age. But lung function decreases slightly each year as you age. Healthy older people can usually breathe without effort.BLOOD PRESSURE Older people may become dizzy when standing up too quickly. This is due to a drop in blood pressure with standing. This kind of drop in blood pressure when standing is called orthostatic hypotension. It is often related to medicines, particularly blood pressure drugs.Risk of having high blood pressure (hypertension) increases as you get older. Other heart-related problems common in older adults include:Very slow pulse or very fast pulseHeart rhythm problems such as atrial fibrillationEFFECTS OF MEDICINES ON VITAL SIGNS Medicines that are used to treat health problems in older people can affect the vital signs. For example, the medicine digoxin, which is used for heart failure, and blood pressure medicines called beta-blockers may cause the pulse to slow.Diuretics (water pills) can cause low blood pressure, most often when changing body position too quickly.OTHER CHANGESAs you grow older, you will have other changes, including: In organs, tissues, and cellsIn the heart and blood vesselsIn the lungs",
Aging spots - should you be concerned?,"Aging spots, also called liver spots or solar lentigos, are very common. They are most often not a cause for worry. They typically develop in people with fair complexions, but people with darker skin can also get them. Aging spots are flat and oval and tan, brown, or black marks. They appear on skin that has been the most exposed to sun over the years, such as the backs of hands, tops of feet, face, shoulders, and upper back. Always let your health care provider know if you have any new or unusual spots, and have them checked. Skin cancers may have many different appearances.

Make sure the harness is fastened snugly.Read the car seat manufacturer's instructions for the proper way to use the seat. Read your vehicle owner's manual, too.Car seats and booster seats should always be used on the back seat of a vehicle. If there is no back seat, the car seat can be secured on the front passenger seat. This can ONLY be done when there is no front or side air bag, or the air bag has been switched off.Even after children are big enough to wear a seat belt, riding in the back seat is safest. When you are selecting a child safety seat for the first time:The seat must fit your child's size and be able to be properly installed in your vehicle.It is best to use a new car seat. Used car seats often do not have instructions. They may have cracks or other problems that make the seat unsafe.

Check that the seat fits your vehicle and child.DO NOT use a car seat past its expiration date. The seat frame may no longer be strong enough to support your child safely. The expiration date is usually on the bottom of the seat.DO NOT use a seat that has been recalled. Fill out and send in the registration card that comes with the new car seat. The manufacturer can contact you if the seat is recalled. You can find out about recalls by contacting the manufacturer, or by looking up safety complaints records on your child's safety seat at www.nhtsa.gov/recalls#car-seats. The types of child safety seats and restraints include:Rear-facing seatsForward-facing seatsBooster seatsCar bedsBuilt-in car seatsTravel vests REAR-FACING SEATSA rear-facing seat is one in which your child faces the back of the vehicle.

Many children grow out of these seats by age 8 to 9 months. Infant-only seats have handles so you can carry the seat to and from the car. Some have a base you can leave installed in the car. This lets you click the car seat into place each time you use it. Follow the manufacturer's instructions on how the seat should be reclined so your baby's head does not shift around while you are driving.Convertible seats. These seats are to be placed in the rear-facing position and are for infants and toddlers. When your child is older and bigger, the seat can be switched to the forward-facing position. Experts recommend keeping your child rear-facing until at least age 3 and until your child outgrows the weight or height allowed by the seat.FORWARD-FACING SEATSA forward-facing seat should be installed on the back seat of your vehicle, although it allows your child to face the front of the car. These seats are used only after your child is too big for a rear-facing seat.A combination forward-facing booster seat may also be used. For younger children, the booster seat's harness straps should be used. After your child reaches the upper height and weight limit for the harness (based on the seat's instructions), the vehicle's own lap and shoulder belts can be used to keep your child strapped in. BOOSTER SEATSA booster seat raises your child up so the vehicle's own lap and shoulder belts fit correctly. The lap belt should fall across your child's upper thighs. The shoulder belt should go across the middle of your child's shoulder and chest.Use booster seats for older children until they are big enough to fit into a seat belt properly. The lap belt should fit low and tight across the upper thighs, and the shoulder belt should fit snug across the shoulder and chest and not cross the neck or face. A child's legs must be long enough so the feet can be flat on the floor. Most children can wear a seatbelt sometime between ages 8 and 12 years.CAR BEDSThese seats are also called flat car seats. They are used for premature or other special-needs babies. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends having a health care provider look at how your preterm baby fits and breathes in a car seat before leaving the hospital.BUILT-IN SEATSSome vehicles have built-in car seats. Weight and height limits vary. You can get more details on these seats by reading the vehicle owner's manual or contacting the vehicle manufacturer.TRAVEL VESTSSpecial vests can be worn by older children who have outgrown forward-facing safety seats.

These may include physical rehabilitation and exercise recommendations, mechanical or electrical therapies, and hot or cold treatments.Chiropractors take a medical history in the same way as other health care providers. They then do an exam to look at:Muscle strength versus weaknessPosture in different positionsSpinal range of motionStructural problemsThey also do standard nervous system and orthopedic tests common to all medical professions.REGULATION OF THE PROFESSIONChiropractors are regulated at two different levels:Board certification is conducted by the National Board of Chiropractor Examiners, which creates national standards for chiropractic care.Licensure takes place at the state level under specific state laws. Licensing and the scope of practice may differ from state to state. Most states require that chiropractors complete the National Chiropractic Board examination before they get their license. Some states also require chiropractors to pass a state examination. All states recognize training from chiropractic schools accredited by the Council of Chiropractic Education (CCE).All states require that chiropractors complete a certain number of continuing education hours every year to keep their license.",

Communicating with patients,"Patient education allows patients to play a bigger role in their own care. It also aligns with patient- and family-centered care.To be effective, patient education needs to be more than instructions and information. Teachers and health care providers need to be able to assess patient needs and communicate clearly.The success of patient education depends largely on how well you assess your patient's:NeedsConcernsReadiness to learnPreferencesSupportBarriers and limitations (such as physical and mental capacity, and low health literacy or numeracy) Often, the first step is to find out what your patient already knows and believes about their health care and condition. Use these guidelines to do a thorough assessment before starting patient education:Gather clues. Talk to the health care team members and observe your patient. Be careful not to make assumptions. Patient teaching based on incorrect assumptions may not be very effective and may take more time. Find out what your patient wants to know or take away from your meeting.Get to know your patient. Introduce yourself and explain your role in your patient's care. Review their medical record and ask basic get-to-know-you questions.Establish a rapport. Make eye contact when appropriate and help your patient feel comfortable with you. Pay attention to your patient's concerns. Sit down near your patient (with their consent).Gain trust. Show respect and treat each patient with compassion and without judgment.Determine your patient's readiness to learn. Ask your patients about their outlooks, attitudes, and motivations.Learn your patient's perspective. Talk to your patient about worries, fears, and possible misconceptions. The information you receive can help guide your patient teaching.Ask the right questions. Ask if your patient has concerns, not just questions. Use open-ended questions that require your patient to reveal more details. Listen carefully. Your patient's answers will help you learn the person's core beliefs. This will help you understand your patient's motivation and let you plan the best ways to teach.Learn about your patient's skills. Find out what your patient already knows. You may want to use the teach-back method (also called the show-me method or closing the loop) to figure out what your patient may have learned from other providers. The teach-back method is a way to confirm that you have explained the information in a way that they understand by asking them to act as if teaching it to you. Also, find out what skills your patient may still need to develop.Involve others. Ask if your patient wants other people involved with the care process. It is possible that the person who volunteers to be involved in your patient's care may not be the person your patient prefers to be involved with. Learn about the support available to your patient.Identify barriers and limitations. You may perceive barriers to education, and your patient may confirm them. Some factors, such as low health literacy or numeracy may be more subtle and harder to recognize.Take time to establish rapport. Do a comprehensive assessment. It is worth it because your patient education efforts will be more effective.",

It is not known if these medicines will affect how well the vaccine works. However, if you take these medicines regularly for other reasons, you can take them as you always do.You should also not take antihistamines to help prevent an allergic reaction before you get the vaccine.If you have any questions about your medicines, ask your provider or the vaccine provider.DURING YOUR VACCINE APPOINTMENTAfter you get your vaccine, you may be asked to wait at the vaccination site for 15 minutes to make sure you do not have a severe allergic reaction to the shot (this is very rare). If you have had a previous severe allergic reaction or if you have had an immediate reaction to immunizations in the past, you may need to wait for 30 minutes as a precaution. Vaccination sites are equipped to provide immediate care for severe allergic reactions and call for emergency medical care.At your appointment, should receive a vaccination card that tells you what vaccine you received and the date and location you received it.

This is because cow's milk doesn't provide enough of certain nutrients such as vitamin E, iron, and essential fatty acids. Also, it's hard for your baby to digest the protein and fat in cow's milk. It is safe though, to give cow's milk to children after they're 1 year old.A child who is 1 or 2 years old should only drink whole milk. This is because the fat in whole milk is needed for your child's developing brain. After 2 years old, children can drink low-fat milk or even skim milk if they are overweight.Some children have problems from drinking cow's milk. For instance, a milk allergy may cause:Belly pain or crampingNausea and vomitingDiarrhea A severe allergy can cause bleeding in the intestines that can lead to anemia. But only about 1% to 3% of children under 1 year old have a milk allergy. It is even less common in children who are older than 1 to 3 years.Lactose intolerance occurs when the small intestine does not make enough of the enzyme lactase. A child who is lactose intolerant can't digest lactose. This is a type of sugar found in milk and other dairy products. The condition can cause bloating and diarrhea.If your child has one of these problems, your health care provider may recommend soy milk. But many children who are allergic to milk are also allergic to soy.Children usually outgrow allergies or intolerances by the time they are 1 year old. But having one food allergy increases the risk for having other types of allergies.If your child can't have dairy or soy, talk to your provider about other food options that will help your child get enough protein and calcium.The US Department of Agriculture recommends the following daily amounts of dairy for children and teens:Under 2 years old: 1? to 2 cups (c) (400 to 480 milliliters [mL])2 through 8 years old: 2 to 2½ c (480 to 600 mL)9 through 18 years old: 3 c (710 mL)1 c (240 ml) of dairy equals:1 c (240 mL) of milk8 ounces (oz) (240 mL) of yogurt2 oz (56 grams) of processed American cheese1 c (240 mL) of pudding made with milk",

Therefore, it is very important that blood flow and breathing be continued until trained medical help arrives. Emergency operators at 911 or the local emergency number can guide you through the process.CPR techniques vary slightly depending on the age or size of the person, including different techniques for adults and children who have reached puberty, children 1 year old until the onset of puberty, and infants (babies less than 1 year of age).",

Crying in childhood,"Children cry for many reasons. Crying is an emotional response to a distressing experience or situation. The degree of a child's distress depends on the child's developmental level and past experiences. Children cry when they feel pain, fear, sadness, frustration, confusion, anger, and when they cannot express their feelings.Crying is a normal response to upsetting situations that a child cannot resolve. When the child's coping skills are used up, crying is automatic and natural.Over time, a child learns to express feelings of frustration, anger, or confusion without crying. Parents may need to set guidelines to help the child develop appropriate behaviors.Praise the child for not crying until the right time and place. Teach other responses to distressing situations. Encourage children to use their words to explain what is upsetting them.As children develop more coping and problem-solving skills, they will cry less often. As they mature, boys tend to cry less than girls. Many believe this difference between boys and girls is a learned behavior.Temper tantrums are unpleasant and disruptive behaviors or emotional outbursts.

Excessive carrying angle of the elbow,"When your arms are held out at your sides and your palms are facing forward, your forearm and hands should normally point about 5 to 15 degrees away from your body. This is the normal ""carrying angle"" of the elbow. This angle allows your forearms to clear your hips when you swing your arms, such as during walking or other activities. It is also important when carrying objects.Certain fractures of the elbow can increase the carrying angle of the elbow, causing the arms to stick out too much from the body. This is called an excessive carrying angle.Other fractures of the elbow can decrease the carrying angle of the elbow. If the angle is decreased, the arm points toward the body. This is known as a ""gunstock deformity.""Because the carrying angle varies from person to person, it is important to compare one elbow with the other when evaluating a problem with the carrying angle.",

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation,"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a treatment that uses a pump to circulate blood through an artificial lung back into the bloodstream of a very ill baby. This system provides heart-lung bypass support outside of the baby's body. It may help support a child who is awaiting a heart or lung transplant.WHY IS ECMO USED?ECMO is used in infants who are sick due to breathing or heart problems. The purpose of ECMO is to provide enough oxygen to the baby while allowing time for the lungs and heart to rest or heal.The most common conditions that may require ECMO are:Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH)Birth defects of the heartMeconium aspiration syndrome (MAS)Severe pneumoniaSevere air leak problemsSevere high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs (PPHN)It may also be used during the recovery period after heart surgery.HOW IS A BABY PLACED ON ECMO?Starting ECMO requires a large team of caregivers to stabilize the baby, as well as the careful set-up and priming of the ECMO pump with fluid and blood. Surgery is performed to attach the ECMO pump to the baby through catheters that are placed into large blood vessels in the baby's neck or groin.WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF ECMO?Because babies who are considered for ECMO are already very sick, they are at high risk for long-term problems, including death. Once the baby is placed on ECMO, additional risks include:BleedingBlood clot formationInfectionTransfusion problems Rarely, the pump can have mechanical problems (tube breaks, pump stops), which can harm the baby.However, most babies who need ECMO would probably die if it were not used.",

Eye - foreign object in,"The eye will often flush out small objects, like eyelashes and sand, through blinking and tearing. DO NOT rub the eye if there is something in it. Wash your hands before examining the eye.Examine the eye in a well-lit area. To find the object, look up and down, then from side to side.If you can't find the object, it may be on the inside of one of the eyelids.

To look inside the upper lid, you can place a cotton-tipped swab on the outside of the upper lid and gently fold the lid over the cotton swab. This is easier to do if you are looking down.If the object is on an eyelid, try to gently flush it out with water or eye drops. If that does not work, try touching a second cotton-tipped swab to the object to remove it.If the object is on the white of the eye, try gently rinsing the eye with water or eye drops. Or, you can GENTLY touch a cotton swap to the object to try to remove it. If the object is on the colored part of the eye, DO NOT attempt to remove it. Your eye may still feel scratchy or uncomfortable after removing an eyelash or other tiny object. This should go away within a day or two.

Eye floaters,"The floating specks you sometimes see in front of your eyes are not on the surface of your eyes but inside them. They are made up of bits of cell debris that drift around in the fluid (vitreous) in the back of your eye. Floaters may look like spots, specks, bubbles, threads, or clumps. Most adults have at least a few floaters. There are times when they may be more visible than at other times, such as when you are reading, especially if the floater is dense or dark.Most of the time floaters are harmless. However, they can be a symptom of a tear in the retina. If you notice a sudden increase in floaters or if you see floaters along with flashes of light in your side vision, this may be a symptom of a retinal tear or detachment. Go to an eye doctor or emergency room if you have these symptoms.TreatmentIt is difficult to eliminate floaters. A vitrectomy can remove floaters, but it is a major eye operation and many doctors feel that it is too risky for a minor problem such as floaters. A YAG laser treatment can break up floaters and possibly make them less visible, but it doesn't really remove the floaters. Research is being done on femtosecond lasers (like the ones often used in LASIK) since this method may prove to be safer. Atropine eye drops, which slightly dilate the pupil, can make floaters less visible. However, the drops may cause blurred vision. Some homeopathic eye drops are marketed as treatment for floaters, but not been shown to have proven benefit.",

Its effects on blood pressure are sometimes seen within a few weeks.This diet is rich in important nutrients and fiber. It also includes foods that are higher in potassium, calcium, and magnesium and lower in sodium (salt) than the typical American diet.The goals of the DASH diet are:Limit sodium to no more than 2,300 mg a day (eating only 1,500 mg a day is an even more effective goal).Reduce saturated fat to no more than 6% of daily calories and total fat to 27% of daily calories. Low-fat dairy products appear to be especially beneficial for lowering systolic blood pressure.When choosing fats, select monounsaturated oils, such as olive or canola oil.Choose whole grains over white flour or pasta products.Choose fresh fruits and vegetables every day. Many of these foods are rich in potassium, fiber, or both.Eat nuts, seeds, or legumes (dried beans or peas) daily.Choose modest amounts of protein (no more than 18% of total daily calories). Fish, skinless poultry, and soy products are the best healthy protein sources.Other daily nutrient goals in the DASH diet include limiting carbohydrates to 55% of daily calories and dietary cholesterol to 150 mg. Try to get at least 30 grams (g) of daily fiber.Check with your provider before you increase the potassium in your diet or use salt substitutes (which often contain potassium). People who have kidney problems or who take certain medicines must be careful about how much potassium they consume.HEART HEALTHY DIETEat foods that are naturally low in fat. These include whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Look at food labels. Pay special attention to the level of saturated fat.Avoid or limit foods that are high in saturated fat (more than 20% of the total fat). Eating too much saturated fat is one of the major risk factors for heart disease. Food high in this type of fat include: egg yolks, hard cheeses, whole milk, cream, ice cream, butter, and fatty meats (and large portions of meats).Choose lean protein foods. These include soy, fish, skinless chicken, very lean meat, and fat-free or 1% fat dairy products.Look for the words ""hydrogenated"" or ""partially hydrogenated"" on food labels. Do not eat foods with these ingredients. They are very high in saturated fats and trans fats.Limit how much fried and processed foods you eat.Limit how many commercially prepared baked goods (such as donuts, cookies, and crackers) you eat. They may contain a lot of saturated fats or trans fats.Pay attention to how foods are prepared. Healthy ways to cook fish, chicken, and lean meats are broiling, grilling, poaching, and baking. Avoid adding high-fat dressings or sauces. Other tips include:Eat foods that are high in soluble fiber. These include oats, bran, split peas and lentils, beans (such as kidney, black, and navy beans), some cereals, and brown rice.Learn how to shop for and cook foods that are healthy for your heart. Learn how to read food labels to choose healthy foods. Stay away from fast food restaurants, where healthy choices can be hard to find.",
High blood pressure and eye disease,High blood pressure can damage blood vessels in the retina. The retina is the layer of tissue at the back part of the eye. It changes light and images that enter the eye into nerve signals that are sent to the brain.,Hypertensive retinopathy
High blood pressure in adults – hypertension,"Blood pressure is a measurement of the force exerted against the walls of your arteries as your heart pumps blood to your body. Hypertension is the medical term used to describe high blood pressure.Untreated high blood pressure can lead to many medical problems. These include heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, eye problems, and other health issues.Blood pressure readings are given as two numbers. The top number is called systolic blood pressure. The bottom number is called diastolic blood pressure. For example, 120 over 80 (written as 120/80 mm Hg).One or both of these numbers can be too high. (Note: These numbers apply to people who are not taking medicines for blood pressure and who are not ill.)Normal blood pressure is when your blood pressure is lower than 120/80 mm Hg most of the time.High blood pressure (hypertension) is when one or both of your blood pressure readings are 130/80 mm Hg or higher most of the time.If the top blood pressure number is from 120 to 129 mm Hg, and the bottom blood pressure number is less than 80 mm Hg, it is called elevated blood pressure.If you have heart or kidney problems, or you had a stroke, your health care provider may want your blood pressure to be even lower than that of people who do not have these conditions.",Hypertension; HBP; High blood pressure

High blood pressure medications,"Treating high blood pressure will help prevent problems such as heart disease, stroke, loss of eyesight, chronic kidney disease, and other blood vessel diseases.You may need to take medicines to lower your blood pressure if lifestyle changes are not enough to bring your blood pressure to the target level.WHEN ARE MEDICINES FOR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE USEDMost of the time, your health care provider will try lifestyle changes first and check your BP two or more times.If your blood pressure is 120/80 to 129/80 mm Hg, you have elevated blood pressure.Your provider will recommend lifestyle changes to bring your blood pressure down to a normal range.Medicines are rarely used at this stage.If your blood pressure is equal to or higher than 130/80 but lower than 140/90 mm Hg, you have Stage 1 high blood pressure. When thinking about the best treatment, you and your provider must consider:If you have no other diseases or risk factors, your provider may recommend lifestyle changes and repeat the measurements after a few months.If your blood pressure remains equal to or higher than 130/80 but lower than 140/90 mm Hg, your provider may recommend medicines to treat high blood pressure.If you have other diseases or risk factors, your provider may be more likely to recommend medicines at the same time as lifestyle changes.If your blood pressure is equal to or higher than 140/90 mm Hg, you have Stage 2 high blood pressure. Your provider will most likely recommend that you take medicines and recommend lifestyle changes.Before making a final diagnosis of either elevated blood pressure or high blood pressure, your provider should ask you to have your blood pressure measured at home, at your pharmacy, or somewhere else besides their office or a hospital.If you have a higher risk for heart disease, diabetes, or a history of a stroke, medicines may be started at lower blood pressure readings. The most commonly used blood pressure targets for people with these medical problems are below 130/80.MEDICINES FOR HIGH BLOOD PRESSUREMost of the time, only a single drug will be used at first. Two drugs may be started if you have stage 2 high blood pressure.Several types of medicine are used to treat high blood pressure. Your provider will decide, with you, which type of medicine is right for you. You may need to take more than one type.Each type of blood pressure medicine listed below comes in different brand and generic names.One or more of these blood pressure medicines are often used to treat high blood pressure:Diuretics are also called water pills. They help your kidneys remove some salt (sodium) from your body. As a result, your blood vessels don't have to hold as much fluid and your blood pressure goes down.Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (also called ACE inhibitors) reduce the production of angiotensin II in your body. This helps relax your blood vessels, which lowers your blood pressure. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (also called ARBs) reduce the action of angiotensin II in your body. This helps relax your blood vessels, which lowers your blood pressure. Calcium channel blockers relax blood vessels by reducing calcium entering cells in the wall of the blood vessels. One category of blood pressure medicines that has been commonly used but is now usually only used if the drugs above are not adequate or cannot be used is beta-blockers. These medicines make the heart beat at a slower rate and with less force.Blood pressure medicines that are not used as often include:Alpha-blockers help relax your blood vessels, which lowers your blood pressure. Centrally acting drugs signal your brain and nervous system to relax your blood vessels. Vasodilators signal the muscles in the walls of blood vessels to relax. Renin inhibitors act by reducing the amount of angiotensin precursors thereby relaxing your blood vessels.SIDE EFFECTS OF BLOOD PRESSURE MEDICINESMost blood pressure medicines are easy to take, but all medicines have side effects. Most of these are mild and may go away over time.Some common side effects of high blood pressure medicines include: Cough Diarrhea or constipation Dizziness or lightheadedness Erection problems Feeling nervous Feeling tired, weak, drowsy, or a lack of energy Headache Nausea or vomiting Skin rash Weight loss or gain without trying Tell your provider as soon as possible if you have side effects or the side effects are causing you problems. Most of the time, making changes to the dose of medicine or when you take it can help reduce side effects. Never change the dose or stop taking a medicine on your own. Always talk to your provider first.OTHER TIPSTaking more than one medicine may change how your body absorbs or uses a drug. Vitamins or supplements, different foods, or alcohol may also change how a drug acts in your body.Always ask your provider whether you need to avoid any foods, drinks, vitamins or supplements, or any other medicines while you are taking blood pressure medicine.",

THINGS TO CONSIDER WHEN CHOOSING A FACILITYWhen you start looking for a nursing home:Work with your social worker or discharge planner from the hospital and ask about the kind of care needed. Ask what facilities they recommend.You can also ask your providers, friends, and family, for recommendations.Make a list of all the nursing homes in or near your area that meet your or your loved one's needs. It's important to do a bit of homework - not all facilities provide the same quality care. Start by looking up facilities on Medicare.gov Nursing Home Compare -- www.medicare.gov/care-compare/?redirect=true&providerType=NursingHome. This allows you to see and compare Medicare- and Medicaid-certified nursing homes based on certain quality measures:Overall ratingHealth inspectionsStaffingQuality measuresNumber of certified bedsIf you can't find a nursing home listed in the website, check to see if it is Medicare/Medicaid certified. Facilities with this certification must meet certain quality standards. If a facility is not certified, you should probably take it off your list. Once you've chosen a few facilities to check out, call each facility and check:If they are taking new patients. Can you get a single room, or will you need to share a room? Single rooms may cost more.The level of care offered. If needed, ask if they offer specialized care, such as stroke rehabilitation or care for dementia patients.Whether they accept Medicare and Medicaid. Once you have a list of facilities that meet your needs, make an appointment to visit each one or ask someone you trust to make the visits. Here are some things to consider during your visit.If possible, the nursing home should be close by so that family members can visit regularly. It's also easier to keep an eye on the level of care being given.What is the security like for the building? Ask about visiting hours and any restrictions on visits.Talk with the staff and observe how they treat residents. Are the interactions friendly, polite, and respectful? Do they call residents by their name?Is there a licensed nursing staff available 24-hours a day? Is a registered nurse available at least 8 hours every day? What happens if a provider is needed?Is there someone on staff to help with social service needs?Do the residents appear clean, well-groomed, and comfortably dressed?Is the environment well-lit, clean, attractive, and at a comfortable temperature? Are there strong unpleasant smells? Is it very noisy in the dining and common areas?Ask about how staff members are hired - are there background checks? Are staff members assigned to specific residents? What is the ratio of staff to residents?Ask about the food and meal schedule. Are there choices for meals? Can they accommodate special diets? Ask if the staff helps residents with eating if needed. Do they make sure the residents are drinking enough fluids? How is this measured?What are the rooms like? Can a resident bring in personal belongings or furniture? How secure are personal belongings?Are there activities available for residents? Medicare.gov offers a helpful Nursing Home Checklist you may want to take with you as you check out different facilities: www.medicare.gov/care-compare/en/assets/resources/nursing-home/nursing-home-checklist.pdf.Try to visit again at a different time of day and week. This can help you get a fuller picture of each facility.PAYING FOR NURSING HOME CARENursing home care is expensive, and most health insurance won't cover the full cost. Often people cover the cost using a combination of self-payment, Medicare, and Medicaid. If you have Medicare, it may pay for short-term care in a nursing home after a 3-day hospitalization. It does not cover long-term care.Medicaid does pay for nursing home care, and many people in nursing homes are on Medicaid. However, you have to be eligible based on your income. Often people start by paying out of pocket. Once they spend down their savings they can apply for Medicaid - even if they've never been on it before. However, spouses are protected against losing their home to pay for a partner's nursing home care.Long-term care insurance, if you have it, may pay for short- or long-term care. There are many different types of long-term insurance; some only pay for nursing home care and others pay for a range of services. You may not be able to get this type of insurance if you have a pre-existing condition. It's a good idea to get legal advice when considering how to pay for nursing care - especially before spending all of your savings. Your local Area Agency on Aging may be able to direct you to legal resources. You can also visit LongTermCare.gov for more information.",Skilled nursing facility - nursing home; Long-term care - nursing home; Short-term care - nursing home
How to choose the best hospital for surgery,"The quality of the health care you receive depends on many things besides the skill of your surgeon. Many health care providers at a hospital will be directly involved in your care before, during, and after surgery.The work of all the hospital staff affects how well the hospital functions. This affects your safety and the quality of the care you will receive there.CHOOSING THE BEST HOSPITAL FOR SURGERYA hospital can offer many things to improve the quality of care you receive. For instance, find out if your hospital has:A floor or unit that does only the type of surgery you are having. (For instance, for hip replacement surgery, do they have a floor or unit that is used only for joint-replacement surgeries?)Specific guidelines or clinical pathways so that everyone who has your type of surgery receives the kind of care they need.Enough surgery specific nurses. It can also be helpful to know how many surgeries like yours have been done at the hospital you have chosen or are considering for your surgery. People who have surgery at hospitals that do more of the same type of procedure often do better.If you are having a surgery that involves newer techniques, find out how many of these procedures your hospital has already done.It is important that you have these discussions with your surgeon before your procedure.HIGH-QUALITY MEASURESHospitals are asked to report events called ""quality measures."" These measures are reports of different things that affect patient care. Some common quality measures include:Patient injuries, such as fallsPatients who receive the wrong medicine or the wrong dosage of a medicineComplications, such as infections, blood clots, and pressure ulcers (bedsores)Readmission (to the hospital after discharge) and death (mortality) rates Hospitals receive scores for their quality. These scores can give you an idea of how your hospital compares to other hospitals.Find out if your hospital is accredited by The Joint Commission (a nonprofit organization that seeks to improve the quality and safety of health care).Also see if your hospital is rated highly by state agencies or consumer or other groups. Some places to look for hospital ratings are:State reports -- some states require hospitals to report certain information to them, and some publish reports that compare hospitals in the state.Nonprofit groups in some areas or states work with businesses, doctors, and hospitals to gather information about quality. You can look for this information online.The US Government gathers and reports information about hospitals. You can find this information online at www.medicare.gov/hospitalcompare/search.html.

How to use a nebulizer,"A nebulizer is a small machine that turns liquid medicine into a mist that can be easily inhaled. You sit with the machine and breathe in the medicine through a connected mouthpiece or facemask. This allows the medicine to enter the lungs directly.Nebulizers may be used for people with lung disease, including:AsthmaChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)Cystic fibrosisBronchiectasisTypes of NebulizersMost nebulizers work by using air compressors to create the mist containing the medicine. A different kind, called an ultrasonic nebulizer, uses sound vibrations. Nebulizers come in three main types:Jet - Compressed air turns the medicine into a mist (tiny particles of medicine that float in the air).Mesh - Medicine is passed through a tiny mesh to create a fine mist.Ultrasonic - High frequency vibrations turn medicine into a mist. The droplets tend to be a bit larger. This kind of nebulizer is quieter, but costs more.A nebulizer can be a smaller portable device or a plug-in tabletop machine you use at home. You will need a prescription from your health care provider to get a nebulizer. Check with your health plan to see if it will cover the cost of the device. Most plans will cover it.Setting Up and Using a NebulizerUse your nebulizer according to the manufacturer's instructions.The basic steps to set up and use your nebulizer are as follows:Wash your hands.Connect the hose to an air compressor.Fill the medicine cup with your medicine. To avoid spills, close the medicine cup tightly and always hold the mouthpiece straight up and down.Attach the other end of the hose to the mouthpiece and medicine cup.Turn on the nebulizer machine.Place the mouthpiece in your mouth. Keep your lips firmly around the mouthpiece so that all of the medicine goes into your lungs. If using a facemask, place it over the mouth and nose. Small children usually do better if they wear a mask.Breathe through your mouth until all the medicine is used. This takes 5 to 20 minutes, depending on the device and medicine used. If needed, use a nose clip so that you breathe only through your mouth.Turn off the machine when done.Wash the medicine cup and mouthpiece with water and air dry until your next treatment.Taking Care of Your NebulizerYou will need to clean your nebulizer to prevent bacteria from growing in it, since bacteria can cause a lung infection. It takes some time to clean your nebulizer and keep it working properly. Be sure to unplug the machine before cleaning it.After each use:Wash the medicine cup and mouthpiece with warm running water.Let them air dry on clean paper towels.Later, hook up the nebulizer and run air through the machine for 20 seconds to make sure all of the parts are dry.Take apart and store the machine in a covered area until the next use.Once per day, you may add a mild dish soap to the cleaning routine above.Once or twice each week:You may add a soaking step to the cleaning routine above.Soak the cup and mouthpiece in 1 part distilled white vinegar, 2 parts warm water solution.You may clean the outside of your machine with a warm, damp cloth as necessary. Never wash the hose or tubing.You will also need to change the filter. The instructions that come with your nebulizer will tell you when you should change the filter.Nebulizers vs. InhalersLike nebulizers, inhalers are also used to send medicine into your lungs. But there are differences.Inhalers:Quickly deliver an exact dose of medicineTake a little practice to use properlyAre smaller and more portableCost less and tend to have fewer side effects than nebulizers, such as rapid heartbeat and jitterinessNebulizers:Allow you to see and feel the medicine as you breathe it in.Can be easier to use because all you have to do is breathe normally. This makes them a good choice for young children and for people with severe lung disease.Take at least 5 to 10 minutes or more to deliver the medicine.May be larger and more bulky, making it harder to use for travel or work.If you have asthma, you may not need to use a nebulizer. You may use an inhaler instead, which is usually just as effective if used properly. But a nebulizer can deliver medicine with less effort and greater predictability than an inhaler. You and your provider can decide if a nebulizer is the best way to get the medicine you need.The choice of device you use may be based on whether you find a nebulizer easier to use and what type of medicine you take.Below are examples of medicines that may be used with a nebulizer:Bronchodilators work by relaxing the muscles of your airways, and this lets you breathe better during an attack or flare-up. Examples include:AlbuterolIpratropiumLevalbuterolCorticosteroids help prevent airways from becoming inflamed and help prevent symptoms. These include:BudesonideFlunisolideFluticasoneTriamcinoloneNebulizers also may be used with:Certain inhaled antibiotics to treat lung infectionsSterile saline solution or medicines to help loosen up mucus in the lungsNote: This is not a comprehensive list of medicines.",Nebulizer - how to use; Asthma - how to use a nebulizer; COPD - how to use a nebulizer; Wheezing - nebulizer; Reactive airway disease - nebulizer; COPD - nebulizer; Chronic bronchitis - nebulizer; Emphysema - nebulizer; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - nebulizer; Cystic fibrosis - nebulizer

Using a spacer wastes a lot less medicine than spraying the medicine into your mouth.Spacers come in different shapes and sizes. Ask your provider which spacer is best for you or your child.

Lung disease,"Lung disease is any problem in the lungs that prevents the lungs from working properly. There are three main types of lung disease:Airway diseases -- These diseases affect the tubes (airways) that carry oxygen and other gases into and out of the lungs. They usually cause a narrowing or blockage of the airways. Airway diseases include asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiolitis, and bronchiectasis (which also is the main disorder for persons with cystic fibrosis). People with airway diseases often say they feel as if they're ""trying to breathe out through a straw.""Lung tissue diseases -- These diseases affect the structure of the lung tissue. Scarring or inflammation of the tissue makes the lungs unable to expand fully (restrictive lung disease). This makes it hard for the lungs to take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide. People with this type of lung disorder often say they feel as if they are ""wearing a too-tight sweater or vest."" As a result, they can't breathe deeply. Pulmonary fibrosis and sarcoidosis are examples of lung tissue disease.Lung circulation diseases -- These diseases affect the blood vessels in the lungs. They are caused by clotting, scarring, or inflammation of the blood vessels. They affect the ability of the lungs to take up oxygen and release carbon dioxide. These diseases may also affect heart function. An example of a lung circulation disease is pulmonary hypertension. People with these conditions often feel very short of breath when they exert themselves. Many lung diseases involve a combination of these three types.The most common lung diseases include:AsthmaCollapse of part or all of the lung (pneumothorax or atelectasis)Swelling and inflammation in the main passages (bronchial tubes) that carry air to the lungs (bronchitis)COPDLung cancerLung infection (pneumonia)Abnormal buildup of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema)Blocked lung artery (pulmonary embolus)",

Physician Assistant profession (PA),"HISTORY OF THE PROFESSIONThe first Physician Assistant (PA) training program was founded in 1965 at Duke University by Dr. Eugene Stead.Programs require applicants to have a bachelor's degree. Applicants also need some experience in the health care setting, such as an emergency medical technician, ambulance attendant, health educator, licensed practical nurse, or associate-degree nurse. The average PA student has a bachelor's degree in some field and about 4 years of health-related experience. Educational programs for PAs are typically associated with colleges of medicine. They vary from 25 to 27 months in length. Programs award a master's degree upon completion.The first PA students were mostly military medics. They were able to expand on the knowledge and experience they received in the military to move into a role in primary care or other specialties. PAs may perform tasks previously only performed by doctors. These include history taking, physical examination, diagnosis, and patient management.Many studies have noted that PAs can provide high-quality health care, comparable to that of a doctor, for about 80% of the conditions seen in primary care settings.SCOPE OF PRACTICEThe PA is prepared, both academically and clinically, to provide health care services under the direction and supervision of a doctor of medicine (MD) or a doctor of osteopathic medicine (DO). PA functions include performing diagnostic, therapeutic, preventive, and health maintenance services.PAs in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and Guam have prescriptive practice privileges. Some PAs may not receive direct third-party (insurance) reimbursement for their services, but their services are billed through their supervising doctor or employer.PRACTICE SETTINGSPAs practice in a variety of settings in nearly every medical and surgical specialty area. Many practice within primary care areas, including family medicine. Other common practice areas are general surgery, surgery specialties, and emergency medicine. The rest are involved in teaching, research, administration, or other nonclinical roles.PAs may practice in any setting in which a physician provides care. This allows doctors to focus their skills and knowledge in a more effective way. PAs practice in both rural and inner city communities. The ability and willingness of PAs to practice in rural areas has improved the distribution of health care providers throughout the general population.REGULATION OF THE PROFESSIONLike many other professions, PAs are regulated at two different levels. They are licensed at the state level according to specific state laws. Certification is established through a national organization. Requirements for minimal practice standards are consistent across all states.Licensure: Laws specific to PA licensure may vary among the states. However, nearly all states require national certification before licensure.All state laws require PAs to have a supervising doctor. This physician does not necessarily have to be onsite at the same location as the PA. Most states allow physician supervision by telephone communication with periodic site visits. Supervising doctors and PAs often have a practice and supervision plan, and sometimes this plan is filed with state agencies.Certification: In the early stages of the profession, the AAPA (American Association of Physician Assistants) joined with the AMA (American Medical Association) and the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) to develop a national competency examination.In 1975, an independent organization, the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants, was established to administer a certification program. This program includes an entry-level examination, continuing medical education, and periodic re-examination for recertification. Only PAs who are graduates of approved programs and have completed and maintained such certification may use the credentials PA-C (certified).For more information, visit the American Academy of Physician Assistants -- www.aapa.org or the National Commission of Certification of Physician Assistants -- www.nccpa.net.",

Portion size,"It can be hard to measure out every portion of food you eat. Yet there are some simple ways to know that you are eating the right serving sizes. Following these tips can help you control portion sizes for healthy weight loss.A recommended serving size is the amount of each food that you are supposed to eat during a meal or snack. A portion is the amount of food that you actually eat. If you eat more or less than the recommended serving size, you may get either too much or too little of the nutrients you need. People with diabetes who use the exchange list for carb counting should keep in mind that a ""serving"" on the exchange list will not always be the same as the recommended serving size. For foods like cereal and pasta, it may be helpful to use measuring cups to measure out an exact serving for a couple of days until you get more practiced at eyeballing the appropriate portion.Use your hand and other everyday objects to measure portion sizes:One serving of meat or poultry is the palm of your hand or a deck of cardsOne 3-ounce (84 grams) serving of fish is a checkbookOne-half cup (40 grams) of ice cream is a tennis ballOne serving of cheese is a pair of diceOne-half cup (80 grams) of cooked rice, pasta, or snacks such as chips or pretzels is a rounded handful, or a tennis ballOne serving of a pancake or waffle is a compact discTwo tablespoons (36 grams) of peanut butter is a ping-pong ball You should eat five or more servings of fruits and vegetables each day to help reduce your risk of cancer and other diseases. Fruits and vegetables are low in fat and high in fiber. They will also help fill you up so that you are satisfied at the end of your meals. They do contain calories, so you should not eat an unlimited amount, especially when it comes to fruits.How to measure out the correct serving sizes of fruits and vegetables:One cup (90 grams) of chopped raw fruits or vegetables is a woman's fist or a baseballOne medium apple or orange is a tennis ballOne-quarter cup (35 grams) of dried fruit or nuts is a golf ball or small handfulOne cup (30 grams) of lettuce is four leaves (Romaine lettuce)One medium baked potato is a computer mouse To control your portion sizes when you are eating at home, try the following tips:Do not eat from the bag. You could be tempted to eat too much. Use the serving size on the package to portion out the snack into small bags or bowls. You can also buy single-serving portions of your favorite snack foods. If you buy in bulk, you can divide snacks up into single-serving portions when you get home from the store.Serve food on smaller plates. Eat from a salad plate instead of a dinner plate. Keep serving dishes on the kitchen counter so you will have to get up for seconds. Putting your food out of easy reach and out of sight will make it harder for you to overeat.Half of your plate should contain non-starchy vegetables. Divide the other half between lean protein and whole grains. Filling half of your plate with non-starchy vegetables, such as leafy greens, before you serve the rest of your entree is one of the easiest methods of portion control.Substitute lower-fat varieties of food. Instead of whole-fat cream cheese, sour cream, and milk, buy low-fat or skim instead. Use half the amount you would normally use to save even more calories. You can try replacing half of the cream cheese with hummus or mix the sour cream with plain yogurt to make this easier.Do not eat mindlessly. When you snack in front of the television or while doing other activities, you will be distracted enough that you may eat too much. Eat at the table. Focus your attention on your food so you will know when you have had enough to eat.Snack between meals if desired. If you are hungry between meals, eat a healthy, high-fiber snack such as a piece of fruit, small salad, or bowl of broth-based soup. The snack will fill you up so that you do not eat too much at your next meal. Snacks that pair protein and carbohydrates with fiber will leave you more satisfied. Some examples are having an apple with string cheese, whole-wheat crackers with peanut butter, or baby carrots with hummus. To control your portion sizes when eating out, try these tips:Order the small size. Instead of a medium or large, ask for the smallest size. By eating a small hamburger instead of a large, you will save about 150 calories. A small order of fries will save you about 300 calories, and a small soda will save 150 calories. Don't super-size your order.Order the ""lunch size"" of a food, rather than the dinner size.Order appetizers rather than entrees.Share your meal. Split an entree with a friend, or cut your meal in half when it arrives. Put one half in a to-go box before you start eating.
